# auto_find_circ
## automating the find_circ pipeline on a server
detecting circular RNA candidates


## will not work if one of these things is missing:
- find_circ scripts from the official repo
- bedtools installed
- bowtie2 installed
- hg19.fa
- circbase.org known circular RNAs mapping file



* directories of mapping files for all scripts need to be changed for each environment*
